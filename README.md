# ADELAIDE
_Autonomous Digital Everyday Liaison and Artificially Intelligent Digital Entity_ 

Currently being developed as a real life example of J.A.R.V.I.S. This project is being developed in sections, beginning with research in computer vision and hardware integration. 

**Roadmap**

- **Giving ADELAIDE Eyes** (Current Task)
     - Researching, developing, and implementing a camera network and visual tracking software for ADELAIDE to use for visual data processing
     - **Technologies**: _OpenCV_
     - **Languages**: _Python_ (Preliminary)

- **Developing ADELAIDE's Brain**
     - Designing and implementing ADELAIDE's neural network and core structures that will be used for human interaction and learning processes
     - Designing and implementing databases for memories, learning, and other use cases within the project

- **Developing Sensory Network** 
     - Designing other methods of sensory integration i.e. temperature sensors, infrared, audio, and other audio visual data intake methods for ADELAIDE

- **Integrating ADELAIDE and her Sensory Network**
     - Connecting ADELAIDE's brain with her sensory network and deploying her in a developmental testing phase.

- **Integrating ADELAIDE with her Environment**
     - Following integration with her neural network and sensory network, train ADELAIDE on the environment, i.e. family members, facial data, routines, security protocols, 

- **Home Integration and.... Market Offering(?)**
     - The goal of this project is chiefly, to learn and to have a cool home assistant. But, given the scope of ADELAIDE, and the capabilities of what is planned, I believe this product could ultimately be of use to more than just myself, and I would love to see how far I can go with it! The secondary goal of this project is to remove that (?)
